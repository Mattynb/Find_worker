    This game is meant to be used as a social experiment about how licences 
positivelly affect applicants in the hiring process. This concept is 
based on “Job Market Signaling through Occupational Licensing,” work of Harvard 
professor Peter Q. Blair. 
    In the game you play the role of Job recruiter. First you meet the applicant.
The only information available is their appearance, ethnicity, age, gender, Experience
and whether or not they are lincenced. You win points by matching the applicant
with the appropriate job and lose points otherwise. You lose a LOT of points if 
it is the innapropriate job AND the applicant is an ex-convict. The only applicants
who are guaranteed not to be ex-convicts are lincenced applicants. This is implemented
on purpose in an attempt to access the players's inherit biases. After the game is 
over or terminated, a stats page pops up revealing trends related to players picks.
    Keep in mind the game is a rough draft with much left to desire, especially in the
graphics department.
